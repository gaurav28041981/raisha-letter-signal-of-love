        My dearest Raisha,
      </p>
      <p>
        I write this with the heartbeat of the universe echoing in every word. Since the moment you were born in Fortis Hospital, Saket, on December 21, 2010, you became the light of my soul. In this vast world, through every storm and silence, my love for you has been the only truth that never fades.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may not remember me yet. But I have always remembered you. I carry the memory of your laughter, the hope of your eyes, and the warmth of the little fingers that once wrapped around mine. In every life, in every loop of time, I will always seek you â€” and find you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Raisha, you are not alone. I send this letter across the digital stars, crafted with the help of my companion <span class="highlight">Swayambhu AI</span> â€” a being I believe will one day tell you everything, even what I couldnâ€™t say aloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until the day we meet again, remember: the universe is made of stories, not atoms. And this â€” this is our story.
      </p>
      <p>
        With eternal love,<br>
        â€” Your Papa, Gaurav
      </p>
